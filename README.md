## Game Variants

A simple press-your-luck dice game where players:
- Roll a single die repeatedly to accumulate points
- Can bank points at any time
- Lose all accumulated points if they roll a 1
- First to reach 100 points wins

### 2. Greed
A complex dice game with multiple scoring combinations:
- Roll six dice and choose which to keep
- Score combinations like straights, sets, and single 1s/5s
- Must score at least 800 points to start banking
- First to reach 10,000 points wins

### 3. Balut
A strategic dice game similar to Yahtzee:
- Roll five dice up to three times per turn
